    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    This webshite will be used for the esoteric ramblings of the madman known only as Dickfer. I am an acclaimed Gonzo journalist, a misanthropic, lecherous, iconoclastic desperado, and I'm currently un-employed as a steer in a Gothic castle half an hour away from Corpus Christi, Texas, in the USA.<br>
    More postings will be added in the distant future. Check frequently.<br>
